       "      <td>This being a baseball site and me (and you, most likely) primarily being a fansof the Chicago Cubs, I don’t usually write things about the Chicago Bears NFL franchise.\\nBut after listening to some of Bears Chairman George McCaskey’s news conference Monday after the firing of the team’s GM Ryan Pace and coach Matt Nagy, I was reminded of the floundering around the Cubs did in the later years of the Wrigley ownership. The only thing really much different was that P.K. Wrigley didn’t do news conferences.\\nThis 670 The Score article by Dan Bernstein sums up the Bears problem:\\nThose of us silly enough to think that [the firings of coach Matt Nagy and general manager Ryan Pace] heralded a new and smarter direction were only encouraged by seeing the team’s official release devoid of other names on the virtual dais, hoping for a newly self-aware restructuring to bring the football side of the Bears’ business up to industry standard.\\nBut there was Ted Phillips, and there he is, still team president and still a key part of the search for this wave of replacements.\\n[Here’s Bill Polian in the role of Ernie Accorsi] , the latest retired football guy to provide some borrowed glimmer of actual credibility in yet another desperate scramble for help.\\nAnd here we are, wondering why we expected it to change.\\nThat was the Cubs of the 1970s. Hiring old hands to manage: Leo Duroocher came from outside the organization, the first such Cubs manager since the 1930s. But after Leo was fired, only Preston Gomez as manager came from outside the ranks, and he didn’t last a full season. Most of the other managers in that era, all Durocher pals or disciples, were pretty feckless — Whitey Lockman, Jim Marshall and Joe Amalfitano. Only Herman Franks had some limited success, and I emphasize “limited.”\\nThe superannuated Charlie Grimm was said to be an informal adviser to P.K. Wrigley until the latter died in 1977, and Grimm was born in 1898 and came to his baseball maturity in the 1920s. That was reflected in everything the Cubs did, from the College of Coaches to constantly trading for over-the-hill veterans who had seen better days with other teams. If the Bears think they’re going to get any modern advice on coaching or executive hires from Polian, who last held an NFL executive position more than a decade ago, they are fooling themselves.\\nI was thinking about all this while listening to McCaskey speak, and then he did this:\\nAsked about former Bears center Olin Kreutz’s recent revelation that his desire to assist with coaching offensive linemen resulted in a purposely unacceptable offer of $15 per hour, McCaskey essentially called him a liar, saying, “I’ve learned over the years to take just about anything Olin says with a grain of salt.” That a righteously angry Kreutz responded shortly thereafter on 670 The Score was already beside the larger point, that the Bears chairman was dumb enough to pick a petty fight with a well-liked and highly visible former player — one of their all-time greats — and on the very day he’s ostensibly trying to make a case for trust in his judgment.\\nAt least no Cubs management or ownership person back in the day ever did that, insulted a beloved former player during a news conference. The Cubs at least treated those folks right.\\nIf you have been critical of Cubs ownership over the last 40 years under Tribune Company and then the Ricketts family, trust me when I tell you that it could be a whole lot worse — and in fact, the last 40 years of Cubs history have included 11 postseason appearances and a World Series title, the latter part of a Cubs Golden Age better than any the franchise had seen in more than 100 years. The last 40 years under the Wrigley ownership produced one NL pennant (1945).\\nJust as P.K. Wrigley ran the Cubs in the 1970s like it was still the late 1940s, the McCaskeys appear to think that George Halas’ hiring of Mike Ditka and the one Super Bowl they won under Ditka’s coaching absolves them of all blame since 1985.\\nIt doesn’t, and nothing will change until the team is sold, and reading between the lines in this Daily Herald article from last May , it feels like that very well could happen when the 99-year-old matriarch Virginia McCaskey passes away. (Note: I certainly don’t ever wish anything ill on Virginia McCaskey, but at 99, her remaining time on Earth is likely limited.) This 2018 Sports Illustrated article , I think, nails it:\\nJeff Davis, a Chicago journalist and author of Papa Bear: The Life and Legacy of George Halas, reached this conclusion: “The McCaskeys are not bad people. It’s unfair to say that. They are good people. But they’re not very hip, and they were not ever supposed to run the Bears.’’\\nSo if you want to know what it felt like to be a Cubs fan around, say, 1980 — just look at the state of the Chicago Bears right now. It feels very much the same. It’s summed up best by this from Jon Greenberg at The Athletic :\\nAnd lastly, when asked for his thoughts on Fields, McCaskey prefaced his remarks with this unfortunate line: “Well, I’m just a fan. I’m not a football evaluator.”\\nIn those two sentences, McCaskey encapsulated the problem with this team. It starts at the top.\\nLet’s re-read that quote from Davis above:\\n“The McCaskeys are not bad people. It’s unfair to say that. They are good people. But they’re not very hip, and they were not ever supposed to run the Bears.’’\\nThat could have described the Wrigley family in the late 1970s. Just as things back then were never going to change with the Cubs until they were sold, we have reached that point with the Chicago Bears (and many would argue we reached that point 20 years ago). Nothing will change until the Bears are sold.\\nThe Wrigleys were forced to sell for estate tax reasons. While that might or might not be the case for the McCaskeys, the time has come for them to sell.</td>\n",

liked and highly visible former player   one of their all time greats   and on the very day he s ostensibly trying to make a case for trust in his judgment  at least no cubs management or ownership person back in the day ever did that  insulted a beloved former player during a news conference  the cubs at least treated those folks right  if you have been critical of cubs ownership over the last    years under tribune company and then the ricketts family  trust me when i tell you that it could be a whole lot worse   and in fact  the last    years of cubs history have included    postseason appearances and a world series title  the latter part of a cubs golden age better than any the franchise had seen in more than     years  the last    years under the wrigley ownership produced one nl pennant         just as p k  wrigley ran the cubs in the     s like it was still the late     s  the mccaskeys appear to think that george halas  hiring of mike ditka and the one super bowl they won under ditka s coaching absolves them of all blame since       it doesn t  and nothing will change until the team is sold  and reading between the lines in this daily herald article from last may   it feels like that very well could happen when the    year old matriarch virginia mccaskey passes away   note  i certainly don t ever wish anything ill on virginia mccaskey  but at     her remaining time on earth is likely limited   this      sports illustrated article   i think  nails it  jeff davis  a chicago journalist and author of papa bear  the life and legacy of george halas  reached this conclusion   the mccaskeys are not bad people  it s unfair to say that  they are good people  but they re not very hip  and they were not ever supposed to run the bears    so if you want to know what it felt like to be a cubs fan around  say         just look at the state of the chicago bears right now  it feels very much the same  it s summed up best by this from jon greenberg at the athletic   and lastly  when asked for his thoughts on fields  mccaskey prefaced his remarks with this unfortunate line   well  i m just a fan  i m not a football evaluator   in those two sentences  mccaskey encapsulated the problem with this team  it starts at the top  let s re read that quote from davis above   the mccaskeys are not bad people  it s unfair to say that  they are good people  but they re not very hip  and they were not ever supposed to run the bears    that could have described the wrigley family in the late     s  just as things back then were never going to change with the cubs until they were sold  we have reached that point with the chicago bears  and many would argue we reached that point    years ago   nothing will change until the bears are sold  the wrigleys were forced to sell for estate tax reasons  while that might or might not be the case for the mccaskeys  the time has come for them to sell</td>\n",

       "      <td>On April 14, 2022, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the entry of summary judgment on claims under the Illinois Whistleblower Act and Illinois Jury Act, concluding that the plaintiff was not terminated for engaging in protected activity. The case is Perez v. Staples Contract &amp; Commercial LLC , No. 21-cv-2601.\\nBackground\\nPlaintiff, a sales representative, was placed on an associate success plan (the “Plan”) in March 2016, after his performance continued to fall below expectations. In May 2016, after the Plan had commenced, plaintiff was summoned for jury duty in Illinois state court.\\nSeparately, in early 2016, Plaintiff allegedly refused to participate in the sale of a laundry detergent product to a client based in New York after learning that the sale of the particular detergent was prohibited under New York law due to its chemical makeup. The sale of the product was not prohibited under Illinois law.\\nPlaintiff’s employment was terminated on June 10, 2016, based on his purported failure to meet performance expectations under the Plan. Plaintiff filed suit in Illinois state court alleging claims of retaliation in violation of the Illinois Jury Act and Illinois Whistleblower Act. Specifically, Plaintiff alleged his employment was terminated because he served on a jury and refused to participate in the laundry detergent sale. Defendant removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and the district court granted summary judgment for the Defendant. Plaintiff appealed the ruling.\\nSeventh Circuit’s Ruling\\nThe Seventh Circuit affirmed the entry of summary judgment in the Defendant’s favor, concluding that Plaintiff failed to show he engaged in protected activity under the Illinois Whistleblower Act when he refused to participate in the sale of laundry detergent in New York. The court observed that the Illinois Whistleblower Act states that “[a]n employer may not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation.” The court concluded that the word “State” under the Illinois Whistleblower Act refers to “Illinois,” and thus asserted violations of a law of another state (here, the New York environmental regulation cited by Plaintiff) could not amount to protected activity under the Illinois Whistleblower Act.\\nIn addition, the court observed that Plaintiff failed to show that the Defendant acted with a retaliatory motive. “Most importantly,” the court noted, Plaintiff’s “‘termination was immediately preceded by an intervening event unrelated to [his] complaints’—here, his three-month failure to comply with the plan’s requirements.”\\nLast, the court determined that Plaintiff failed to show his jury service was a proximate cause for his termination under the Illinois Jury Act because his supervisor’s purported facial reactions and comments after being informed of his jury service were not enough for a reasonable jury to conclude that Plaintiff was discharged because of his jury service.\\nSignificance\\nThe Staples decision confirms that the Illinois Whistleblower Act only encompasses violations of Illinois laws, rules, or regulations. In other words, an employee does not engage in protected activity under the Illinois Whistleblower Act by raising a complaint about a potential violation of a different state’s law.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- It \"seems unlikely\" Musk will get help from private equity firms with funding his $43 billion bid to buy Twitter and take it private, according to CNBC's David Faber. - Faber said the rates of return for private equity \"don't work.\" It \"seems unlikely\" Musk will get help from private equity firms with his $43 billion bid to buy Twitter and take it private, according to CNBC's David Faber. \"The more I report, the less I believe there's anybody else that really could show up here,\" Faber said on CNBC's \" Squawk on the Street \" Tuesday. Though reports have suggested private equity firm Thoma Bravo may be interested in a bid for Twitter, Faber said the rates of return \"don't work.\" Fellow private equity firm Apollo isn't interested in joining a private equity consortium to acquire the social media company, according to sources who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. While Musk is considered to be the world's richest man, much of his assets are tied up in Tesla stock, meaning he'd likely have to either sell stock or borrow money to fund the deal. \"Yeah, he can do it, we know that,\" Faber said. \"But how's he going to do it? Is he really going to choose to put that much of his net worth at risk?\" Money Report \"Private equity is not real. That's all some marketing,\" Faber said. Gordon Haskett Research Advisors analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday that the Wall Street Journal report, which first revealed Apollo was considering getting involved in a Twitter deal, \"didn't impress us much, mainly because we've assumed most of the usual suspects, Apollo included, are updating their models.\" But the analysts said Apollo could potentially help a firm like Thoma Bravo with its financing, noting it's \"played a similar role on some other Bravo deals.\" Apollo and Thoma Bravo did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.

       "63      This being a baseball site and me (and you, most likely) primarily being a fansof the Chicago Cubs, I don’t usually write things about the Chicago Bears NFL franchise.\\nBut after listening to some of Bears Chairman George McCaskey’s news conference Monday after the firing of the team’s GM Ryan Pace and coach Matt Nagy, I was reminded of the floundering around the Cubs did in the later years of the Wrigley ownership. The only thing really much different was that P.K. Wrigley didn’t do news conferences.\\nThis 670 The Score article by Dan Bernstein sums up the Bears problem:\\nThose of us silly enough to think that [the firings of coach Matt Nagy and general manager Ryan Pace] heralded a new and smarter direction were only encouraged by seeing the team’s official release devoid of other names on the virtual dais, hoping for a newly self-aware restructuring to bring the football side of the Bears’ business up to industry standard.\\nBut there was Ted Phillips, and there he is, still team president and still a key part of the search for this wave of replacements.\\n[Here’s Bill Polian in the role of Ernie Accorsi] , the latest retired football guy to provide some borrowed glimmer of actual credibility in yet another desperate scramble for help.\\nAnd here we are, wondering why we expected it to change.\\nThat was the Cubs of the 1970s. Hiring old hands to manage: Leo Duroocher came from outside the organization, the first such Cubs manager since the 1930s. But after Leo was fired, only Preston Gomez as manager came from outside the ranks, and he didn’t last a full season. Most of the other managers in that era, all Durocher pals or disciples, were pretty feckless — Whitey Lockman, Jim Marshall and Joe Amalfitano. Only Herman Franks had some limited success, and I emphasize “limited.”\\nThe superannuated Charlie Grimm was said to be an informal adviser to P.K. Wrigley until the latter died in 1977, and Grimm was born in 1898 and came to his baseball maturity in the 1920s. That was reflected in everything the Cubs did, from the College of Coaches to constantly trading for over-the-hill veterans who had seen better days with other teams. If the Bears think they’re going to get any modern advice on coaching or executive hires from Polian, who last held an NFL executive position more than a decade ago, they are fooling themselves.\\nI was thinking about all this while listening to McCaskey speak, and then he did this:\\nAsked about former Bears center Olin Kreutz’s recent revelation that his desire to assist with coaching offensive linemen resulted in a purposely unacceptable offer of $15 per hour, McCaskey essentially called him a liar, saying, “I’ve learned over the years to take just about anything Olin says with a grain of salt.” That a righteously angry Kreutz responded shortly thereafter on 670 The Score was already beside the larger point, that the Bears chairman was dumb enough to pick a petty fight with a well-liked and highly visible former player — one of their all-time greats — and on the very day he’s ostensibly trying to make a case for trust in his judgment.\\nAt least no Cubs management or ownership person back in the day ever did that, insulted a beloved former player during a news conference. The Cubs at least treated those folks right.\\nIf you have been critical of Cubs ownership over the last 40 years under Tribune Company and then the Ricketts family, trust me when I tell you that it could be a whole lot worse — and in fact, the last 40 years of Cubs history have included 11 postseason appearances and a World Series title, the latter part of a Cubs Golden Age better than any the franchise had seen in more than 100 years. The last 40 years under the Wrigley ownership produced one NL pennant (1945).\\nJust as P.K. Wrigley ran the Cubs in the 1970s like it was still the late 1940s, the McCaskeys appear to think that George Halas’ hiring of Mike Ditka and the one Super Bowl they won under Ditka’s coaching absolves them of all blame since 1985.\\nIt doesn’t, and nothing will change until the team is sold, and reading between the lines in this Daily Herald article from last May , it feels like that very well could happen when the 99-year-old matriarch Virginia McCaskey passes away. (Note: I certainly don’t ever wish anything ill on Virginia McCaskey, but at 99, her remaining time on Earth is likely limited.) This 2018 Sports Illustrated article , I think, nails it:\\nJeff Davis, a Chicago journalist and author of Papa Bear: The Life and Legacy of George Halas, reached this conclusion: “The McCaskeys are not bad people. It’s unfair to say that. They are good people. But they’re not very hip, and they were not ever supposed to run the Bears.’’\\nSo if you want to know what it felt like to be a Cubs fan around, say, 1980 — just look at the state of the Chicago Bears right now. It feels very much the same. It’s summed up best by this from Jon Greenberg at The Athletic :\\nAnd lastly, when asked for his thoughts on Fields, McCaskey prefaced his remarks with this unfortunate line: “Well, I’m just a fan. I’m not a football evaluator.”\\nIn those two sentences, McCaskey encapsulated the problem with this team. It starts at the top.\\nLet’s re-read that quote from Davis above:\\n“The McCaskeys are not bad people. It’s unfair to say that. They are good people. But they’re not very hip, and they were not ever supposed to run the Bears.’’\\nThat could have described the Wrigley family in the late 1970s. Just as things back then were never going to change with the Cubs until they were sold, we have reached that point with the Chicago Bears (and many would argue we reached that point 20 years ago). Nothing will change until the Bears are sold.\\nThe Wrigleys were forced to sell for estate tax reasons. While that might or might not be the case for the McCaskeys, the time has come for them to sell.   \n",

The case is Perez v. Staples Contract & Commercial LLC , No. 21-cv-2601.\\nBackground\\nPlaintiff, a sales representative, was placed on an associate success plan (the “Plan”) in March 2016, after his performance continued to fall below expectations. In May 2016, after the Plan had commenced, plaintiff was summoned for jury duty in Illinois state court.\\nSeparately, in early 2016, Plaintiff allegedly refused to participate in the sale of a laundry detergent product to a client based in New York after learning that the sale of the particular detergent was prohibited under New York law due to its chemical makeup. The sale of the product was not prohibited under Illinois law.\\nPlaintiff’s employment was terminated on June 10, 2016, based on his purported failure to meet performance expectations under the Plan. Plaintiff filed suit in Illinois state court alleging claims of retaliation in violation of the Illinois Jury Act and Illinois Whistleblower Act. Specifically, Plaintiff alleged his employment was terminated because he served on a jury and refused to participate in the laundry detergent sale. Defendant removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and the district court granted summary judgment for the Defendant. Plaintiff appealed the ruling.\\nSeventh Circuit’s Ruling\\nThe Seventh Circuit affirmed the entry of summary judgment in the Defendant’s favor, concluding that Plaintiff failed to show he engaged in protected activity under the Illinois Whistleblower Act when he refused to participate in the sale of laundry detergent in New York. The court observed that the Illinois Whistleblower Act states that “[a]n employer may not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation.” The court concluded that the word “State” under the Illinois Whistleblower Act refers to “Illinois,” and thus asserted violations of a law of another state (here, the New York environmental regulation cited by Plaintiff) could not amount to protected activity under the Illinois Whistleblower Act.\\nIn addition, the court observed that Plaintiff failed to show that the Defendant acted with a retaliatory motive. “Most importantly,” the court noted, Plaintiff’s “‘termination was immediately preceded by an intervening event unrelated to [his] complaints’—here, his three-month failure to comply with the plan’s requirements.”\\nLast, the court determined that Plaintiff failed to show his jury service was a proximate cause for his termination under the Illinois Jury Act because his supervisor’s purported facial reactions and comments after being informed of his jury service were not enough for a reasonable jury to conclude that Plaintiff was discharged because of his jury service.\\nSignificance\\nThe Staples decision confirms that the Illinois Whistleblower Act only encompasses violations of Illinois laws, rules, or regulations. In other words, an employee does not engage in protected activity under the Illinois Whistleblower Act by raising a complaint about a potential violation of a different state’s law.   \n",

CHICAGO (CBS) — They’re a local nonprofit that recently landed a major donation from a celebrity, and we wondered what they’re all about and how they help low-income families live a better life.\\nMorning Insider Tim McNicholas introduces us to Community Organizing and Family Issues – or COFI.\\nIt’s not your average conference call, it’s a pep rally of sorts for COFI – a nonprofit that works to improve the lives of low-income families and their families – and at this meeting, there were at least 2 million reasons why the energy is so high.\\n“The greatest donation in our over 20 year history, of $2 million from Mackenzie Scott.”\\nScott — the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos —made the donation earlier this month.\\nThe parent-based nonprofit says it will help them fund college savings accounts for local kids and fight for change – including increased mental health services in schools.\\nIt’s great news for Dexter Leggin – a volunteer and single parent who says COFI helped him raise his son.\\n“I’m in a community that is deprived of a lot of things, a lot of resources, and we have a lot of kids that’s in trauma. So that’s probably why it’s so important to me,” he said.\\nThe group held a rally before a meeting with lawmakers in Springfield, via Zoom, to discuss the changes they’re fighting for.\\n“We’re working on mental health within our communities. We are working on helping with early learning,” said Rosalia Salgado, a parent leader and co-president of COFI. “It’s important to me, because I know COFI has helped my family succeed, and I want to give that to other families.”\\nFor Salgado, that’s something worth cheering for.\\nShare this news on your Fb,Twitter and Whatsapp\\nTimes News Express – Breaking News Updates – Latest News Headlines\\nTimes News Express || USA NEWS || WORLD NEWS || CELEBRITY NEWS || POLITICS || TOP STORIES   \n",

Though reports have suggested private equity firm Thoma Bravo may be interested in a bid for Twitter, Faber said the rates of return \"don't work.\" Fellow private equity firm Apollo isn't interested in joining a private equity consortium to acquire the social media company, according to sources who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. While Musk is considered to be the world's richest man, much of his assets are tied up in Tesla stock, meaning he'd likely have to either sell stock or borrow money to fund the deal. \"Yeah, he can do it, we know that,\" Faber said. \"But how's he going to do it? Is he really going to choose to put that much of his net worth at risk?\" Money Report \"Private equity is not real. That's all some marketing,\" Faber said. Gordon Haskett Research Advisors analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday that the Wall Street Journal report, which first revealed Apollo was considering getting involved in a Twitter deal, \"didn't impress us much, mainly because we've assumed most of the usual suspects, Apollo included, are updating their models.\" But the analysts said Apollo could potentially help a firm like Thoma Bravo with its financing, noting it's \"played a similar role on some other Bravo deals.\" Apollo and Thoma Bravo did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

       "63      this being a baseball site and me  and you  most likely  primarily being a fansof the chicago cubs  i don t usually write things about the chicago bears nfl franchise  but after listening to some of bears chairman george mccaskey s news conference monday after the firing of the team s gm ryan pace and coach matt nagy  i was reminded of the floundering around the cubs did in the later years of the wrigley ownership  the only thing really much different was that p k  wrigley didn t do news conferences  this     the score article by dan bernstein sums up the bears problem  those of us silly enough to think that  the firings of coach matt nagy and general manager ryan pace  heralded a new and smarter direction were only encouraged by seeing the team s official release devoid of other names on the virtual dais  hoping for a newly self aware restructuring to bring the football side of the bears  business up to industry standard  but there was ted phillips  and there he is  still team president and still a key part of the search for this wave of replacements   here s bill polian in the role of ernie accorsi    the latest retired football guy to provide some borrowed glimmer of actual credibility in yet another desperate scramble for help  and here we are  wondering why we expected it to change  that was the cubs of the     s  hiring old hands to manage  leo duroocher came from outside the organization  the first such cubs manager since the     s  but after leo was fired  only preston gomez as manager came from outside the ranks  and he didn t last a full season  most of the other managers in that era  all durocher pals or disciples  were pretty feckless   whitey lockman  jim marshall and joe amalfitano  only herman franks had some limited success  and i emphasize  limited   the superannuated charlie grimm was said to be an informal adviser to p k  wrigley until the latter died in       and grimm was born in      and came to his baseball maturity in the     s  that was reflected in everything the cubs did  from the college of coaches to constantly trading for over the hill veterans who had seen better days with other teams  if the bears think they re going to get any modern advice on coaching or executive hires from polian  who last held an nfl executive position more than a decade ago  they are fooling themselves  i was thinking about all this while listening to mccaskey speak  and then he did this  asked about former bears center olin kreutz s recent revelation that his desire to assist with coaching offensive linemen resulted in a purposely unacceptable offer of     per hour  mccaskey essentially called him a liar  saying   i ve learned over the years to take just about anything olin says with a grain of salt   that a righteously angry kreutz responded shortly thereafter on     the score was already beside the larger point  that the bears chairman was dumb enough to pick a petty fight with a well liked and highly visible former player   one of their all time greats   and on the very day he s ostensibly trying to make a case for trust in his judgment  at least no cubs management or ownership person back in the day ever did that  insulted a beloved former player during a news conference  the cubs at least treated those folks right  if you have been critical of cubs ownership over the last    years under tribune company and then the ricketts family  trust me when i tell you that it could be a whole lot worse   and in fact  the last    years of cubs history have included    postseason appearances and a world series title  the latter part of a cubs golden age better than any the franchise had seen in more than     years  the last    years under the wrigley ownership produced one nl pennant         just as p k  wrigley ran the cubs in the     s like it was still the late     s  the mccaskeys appear to think that george halas  hiring of mike ditka and the one super bowl they won under ditka s coaching absolves them of all blame since       it doesn t  and nothing will change until the team is sold  and reading between the lines in this daily herald article from last may   it feels like that very well could happen when the    year old matriarch virginia mccaskey passes away   note  i certainly don t ever wish anything ill on virginia mccaskey  but at     her remaining time on earth is likely limited   this      sports illustrated article   i think  nails it  jeff davis  a chicago journalist and author of papa bear  the life and legacy of george halas  reached this conclusion   the mccaskeys are not bad people  it s unfair to say that  they are good people  but they re not very hip  and they were not ever supposed to run the bears    so if you want to know what it felt like to be a cubs fan around  say         just look at the state of the chicago bears right now  it feels very much the same  it s summed up best by this from jon greenberg at the athletic   and lastly  when asked for his thoughts on fields  mccaskey prefaced his remarks with this unfortunate line   well  i m just a fan  i m not a football evaluator   in those two sentences  mccaskey encapsulated the problem with this team  it starts at the top  let s re read that quote from davis above   the mccaskeys are not bad people  it s unfair to say that  they are good people  but they re not very hip  and they were not ever supposed to run the bears    that could have described the wrigley family in the late     s  just as things back then were never going to change with the cubs until they were sold  we have reached that point with the chicago bears  and many would argue we reached that point    years ago   nothing will change until the bears are sold  the wrigleys were forced to sell for estate tax reasons  while that might or might not be the case for the mccaskeys  the time has come for them to sell    \n",

activity under the illinois whistleblower act when he refused to participate in the sale of laundry detergent in new york  the court observed that the illinois whistleblower act states that   a n employer may not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of a state or federal law  rule  or regulation   the court concluded that the word  state  under the illinois whistleblower act refers to  illinois   and thus asserted violations of a law of another state  here  the new york environmental regulation cited by plaintiff  could not amount to protected activity under the illinois whistleblower act  in addition  the court observed that plaintiff failed to show that the defendant acted with a retaliatory motive   most importantly   the court noted  plaintiff s   termination was immediately preceded by an intervening event unrelated to  his  complaints  here  his three month failure to comply with the plan s requirements   last  the court determined that plaintiff failed to show his jury service was a proximate cause for his termination under the illinois jury act because his supervisor s purported facial reactions and comments after being informed of his jury service were not enough for a reasonable jury to conclude that plaintiff was discharged because of his jury service  significance the staples decision confirms that the illinois whistleblower act only encompasses violations of illinois laws  rules  or regulations  in other words  an employee does not engage in protected activity under the illinois whistleblower act by raising a complaint about a potential violation of a different state s law    \n",

faber    faber said the rates of return for private equity  don t work   it  seems unlikely  musk will get help from private equity firms with his     billion bid to buy twitter and take it private  according to cnbc s david faber   the more i report  the less i believe there s anybody else that really could show up here   faber said on cnbc s   squawk on the street   tuesday  though reports have suggested private equity firm thoma bravo may be interested in a bid for twitter  faber said the rates of return  don t work   fellow private equity firm apollo isn t interested in joining a private equity consortium to acquire the social media company  according to sources who asked not to be named because the discussions are private  while musk is considered to be the world s richest man  much of his assets are tied up in tesla stock  meaning he d likely have to either sell stock or borrow money to fund the deal   yeah  he can do it  we know that   faber said   but how s he going to do it  is he really going to choose to put that much of his net worth at risk   money report  private equity is not real  that s all some marketing   faber said  gordon haskett research advisors analysts wrote in a note on tuesday that the wall street journal report  which first revealed apollo was considering getting involved in a twitter deal   didn t impress us much  mainly because we ve assumed most of the usual suspects  apollo included  are updating their models   but the analysts said apollo could potentially help a firm like thoma bravo with its financing  noting it s  played a similar role on some other bravo deals   apollo and thoma bravo did not immediately respond to cnbc s requests for comment  cnbc s alex sherman contributed to this report  watch  apollo may participate in

       "      <td>CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago school leaders canceled classes Thursday for a second consecutive day after failing to reach agreement with the teachers union over COVID-19 safety protocols in the nation’s third-largest school district. The Chicago Teachers Union sought to revert to remote instruction during the latest surge of infections and while both sides hammer out a deal. But Chicago Public Schools leaders have said remote learning didn’t work and schools can safely remain open with protocols in place. The move to cancel classes and activities Thursday affects roughly 350,000 students and came after closed-door negotiations Wednesday failed to produce a deal. The issues include metrics for closing schools. “We have no choice but to cancel classes tomorrow,” Schools CEO Pedro Martinez said at a Wednesday evening news conference. Students returned to class Monday after a two-week winter break with COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations fueled by the omicron variant at record levels. School districts nationwide have grappled with the same issue , with most opting to stay open while ramping up virus testing, tweaking protocols and other adjustments in response to the shifting pandemic. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, echoing President Joe Biden a day earlier , said Wednesday that the country is better equipped now to make sure schools can safely open “including in Chicago,” while former President Donald Trump called the closures “devastating.” Chicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey said teachers don’t want to return to in-person instruction until the current surge has subsided. “We’d rather be in our classes teaching, we’d rather have the schools open. What we are saying though is that right now we’re in the middle of a major surge, it is breaking all the records and hospitals are full,” he said during a Wednesday morning news conference with other union officials, teachers and parents. The union’s action, approved by 73% of members, called for remote instruction until “cases substantially subside” or union leaders approve an agreement for safety protocols with the district. The district said early Tuesday that classes would be canceled Wednesday if the union voted not to return to in-person instruction. Devices were not distributed to students ahead of the union vote, which was announced just before 11 p.m. Tuesday. Union members who tried to log into teaching systems Wednesday said they were locked out. District officials blamed the union for the late cancellation, saying despite safety measures including a high teacher vaccination rate, “our teachers are not willing to report to work.” “We are deeply concerned about this decision but even more concerned about its impact on the health, safety, and well-being of our students and families,\" the district said in a statement. CPS leaders said a plan would come later Wednesday to “continue student learning” in the district, where students are largely low income and Black and Latino. School officials labeled the union action an “illegal work stoppage” and said those who did not report to schools Wednesday would not be compensated. Last year during a similar debate, the district punished teachers who did not come to schools . Keyonna Payton, a teacher at Park Manor Elementary School who also chairs its safety committee, said she taught remotely Monday and Tuesday because most of her students were at home under quarantine. Payton said she is vaccinated and boosted, and she has a child who attends classes in the district who is also vaccinated, but she's fearful of the variant spreading to her family, including her 91-year-old grandmother. “I’m doing my part to try to protect my children. However, I am afraid of this virus and variant because of how fast it is moving and spreading,” she said during the Wednesday news conference. Danelda Craig, a parent who also spoke at the news conference, said she was “taken aback” by a suggestion from the city’s public health commissioner that people could wear two masks to improve protection. Craig said most children struggle with one. “We want them to go to school,” she said. “What we don’t want is COVID with it.” In Illinois, masks are required in indoor settings, including schools. While some significantly smaller, neighboring school districts have returned or plan to return to class this week, others have temporarily returned to remote learning. Niles Township High School District 219 in Skokie, just north of Chicago, switched to remote learning for the first two weeks of January due to staffing shortages, while the Lincoln Way district southwest of Chicago did so for one week, also due to staffing. In Chicago, the district proposed guidelines for individual school closures, saying safety measures like required masks, availability of vaccines and improved ventilation make schools among the safest places for kids to be. Roughly 100,000 students and 91% of CPS’ more than 47,000 staff in the district are vaccinated, according to the district. But the union, with roughly 25,000 members, has proposed metrics for districtwide closure, citing risks to students and teachers. A fierce battle took place last January over similar issues. The district said it has provided 200,000 KN95 masks to teachers, would allow schools to resume daily health screening questions for students and building visitors and would spell out metrics for closing individual schools. Schools CEO Pedro Martinez said buildings would remain open for “essential services,” but not instruction. The district said food service and COVID-19 testing would be available at schools but after-school activities would be canceled. ___ Associated Press writers Sara Burnett in Chicago and Rick Callahan in Indianapolis contributed to this report. ___ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen Sophia Tareen, The Associated Press</td>\n",

       "      <td>CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago school leaders canceled classes for a second straight day after failing to reach an agreement Wednesday with the teachers union over remote learning and other COVID-19 safety protocols in the nation's third-largest school district. The Chicago Teachers Union, which voted to revert to online instruction, told teachers to stay home Wednesday during the latest COVID-19 surge while both sides negotiate, prompting district officials to cancel classes two days after students returned from winter break. Chicago Public Schools, like most other districts, has rejected retuning to remote learning, saying it worsened racial inequities and was detrimental to academic performance, mental health and attendance. District officials insist schools can safely remain open with protocols in place. Both sides negotiated behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon but failed to produce an agreement. The issues include metrics that would trigger school closures and more COVID-19 testing. For instance, school leaders support remote learning only at the classroom and school level when there are outbreaks, as has been the case this year, versus a districtwide switch to remote learning which the union has supported. “We know that our schools are safe. Yes. Do we have challenges across individual schools? Absolutely. Do we respond? Absolutely,\" Schools CEO Pedro Martinez told reporters Wednesday evening. He said the situation with the union left “no choice but to cancel” Thursday, something that will affect roughly 350,000 students. Martinez said students may be able to start returning to schools on Friday for services like tutoring or counseling depending on how many staff members show up. Buildings stayed open Wednesday for meal pickup in the largely low-income and Black and Latino school district. Union President Jesse Sharkey said teachers don’t want to return to in-person instruction until the current surge has subsided. “We’d rather be in our classes teaching, we’d rather have the schools open. What we are saying though is that right now we’re in the middle of a major surge, it is breaking all the records and hospitals are full,” he said during a Wednesday morning news conference. The union has argued that the district's safety measures fall short, including a holiday testing program, and that its COVID-19 infection data is often inaccurate. They've sought demands similar to a safety agreement put in place last year after a fierce debate. However, the district says the pandemic is different now than a year ago and requires a different response, particularly with a highly-vaccinated teacher population. City officials, who've characterized the union action as an “illegal work stoppage” and said teachers that don't show up won't be paid, were also mulling legal options to force teachers back in classrooms. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint, but didn't elaborate. School districts nationwide have grappled with the same issues , with most opting to stay open while ramping up virus testing, tweaking protocols and other adjustments in response to the shifting pandemic. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, echoing President Joe Biden a day earlier , said Wednesday that the country is better equipped now to make sure schools can safely open “including in Chicago,” while former President Donald Trump called the closures “devastating.” The cancelation meant more frustration for families strained by the pandemic who would again have to make other arrangements. The disruptions follow a teachers strike in 2019 . Parent Danelda Craig, who spoke at the union’s news conference, said she was “taken aback” by the city’s public health commissioner’s suggestion that people could wear two masks to improve protection. Craig said most children struggle with one. “We want them to go to school,” she said. “What we don’t want is COVID with it.” Still, some schools reported low attendance this week, with students either in required isolation or staying home voluntarily to avoid exposure during the omicron-fueled surge. Infections and hospitalizations are at record levels nationwide, including in Chicago which reported 4,775 average daily cases, up from under 1,000 a month ago. Phillip Cantor, a science teacher at North-Grand High School on the West Side, said his freshman and senior classes were about half empty earlier this week as his email filled with alerts about students forced to remain out due to COVID exposure. More than a dozen teachers also were out and there was one substitute available, so other teachers and staff helped monitor their classrooms, he said. Cantor said voting in favor of Wednesday’s remote action was difficult because a lack of laptops and internet access made it likely that all of his students couldn’t flip overnight. But he called school days like those following the winter break “completely untenable” and risky. “I’m not worried about my own health really, but I have students who have lost multiple family members in this pandemic,” Cantor said. “There’s been a lot of COVID-related trauma in the community and I don’t want to see more.” District officials blamed the union for the situation, saying it spent about $100 million on its school safety plan, including classroom air purifiers. Masks are required in schools and 91% of CPS’ more than 47,000 staff are vaccinated, according to the district. Some classes and schools have temporarily gone remote with outbreaks this academic year. And Chicago purchased 100,000 laptops last month in anticipation of more remote instruction, but it was unclear how many students have school-issued devices. The union and parents have complained that there aren’t enough and access has been unequal. District officials sidestepped recent questions about the school-issued devices. ——— Associated Press writers Sara Burnett and Kathleen Foody in Chicago and Rick Callahan in Indianapolis contributed to this report.</td>\n",
       "      <td>chicago  ap    chicago school leaders canceled classes for a second straight day after failing to reach an agreement wednesday with the teachers union over remote learning and other covid    safety protocols in the nation s third largest school district  the chicago teachers union  which voted to revert to online instruction  told teachers to stay home wednesday during the latest covid    surge while both sides negotiate  prompting district officials to cancel classes two days after students returned from winter break  chicago public schools  like most other districts  has rejected retuning to remote learning  saying it worsened racial inequities and was detrimental to academic performance  mental health and attendance  district officials insist schools can safely remain open with protocols in place  both sides negotiated behind closed doors wednesday afternoon but failed to produce an agreement  the issues include metrics that would trigger school closures and more covid    testing  for instance  school leaders support remote learning only at the classroom and school level when there are outbreaks  as has been the case this year  versus a districtwide switch to remote learning which the union has supported   we know that our schools are safe  yes  do we have challenges across individual schools  absolutely  do we respond  absolutely   schools ceo pedro martinez told reporters wednesday evening  he said the situation with the union left  no choice but to cancel  thursday  something that will affect roughly         students  martinez said students may be able to start returning to schools on friday for services like tutoring or counseling depending on how many staff members show up  buildings stayed open wednesday for meal pickup in the largely low income and black and latino school district  union president jesse sharkey said teachers don t want to return to in person instruction until the current surge has subsided   we d rather be in our classes teaching  we d rather have the schools open  what we are saying though is that right now we re in the middle of a major surge  it is breaking all the records and hospitals are full   he said during a wednesday morning news conference  the union has argued that the district s safety measures fall short  including a holiday testing program  and that its covid    infection data is often inaccurate  they ve sought demands similar to a safety agreement put in place last year after a fierce debate  however  the district says the pandemic is different now than a year ago and requires a different response  particularly with a highly vaccinated teacher population  city officials  who ve characterized the union action as an  illegal work stoppage  and said teachers that don t show up won t be paid  were also mulling legal options to force teachers back in classrooms  mayor lori lightfoot said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint  but didn t elaborate  school districts nationwide have grappled with the same issues   with most opting to stay open while ramping up virus testing  tweaking protocols and other adjustments in response to the shifting pandemic  white house press secretary jen psaki  echoing president joe biden a day earlier   said wednesday that the country is better equipped now to make sure schools can safely open  including in chicago   while former president donald trump called the closures  devastating   the cancelation meant more frustration for families strained by the pandemic who would again have to make other arrangements  the disruptions follow a teachers strike in        parent danelda craig  who spoke at the union s news conference  said she was  taken aback  by the city s public health commissioner s suggestion that people could wear two masks to improve protection  craig said most children struggle with one   we want them to go to school   she said   what we don t want is covid with it   still  some schools reported low attendance this week  with students either in required isolation or staying home voluntarily to avoid exposure during the omicron fueled surge  infections and hospitalizations are at record levels nationwide  including in chicago which reported       average daily cases  up from under       a month ago  phillip cantor  a science teacher at north grand

       "0                                                                                                  CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago school leaders canceled classes Thursday for a second consecutive day after failing to reach agreement with the teachers union over COVID-19 safety protocols in the nation’s third-largest school district. The Chicago Teachers Union sought to revert to remote instruction during the latest surge of infections and while both sides hammer out a deal. But Chicago Public Schools leaders have said remote learning didn’t work and schools can safely remain open with protocols in place. The move to cancel classes and activities Thursday affects roughly 350,000 students and came after closed-door negotiations Wednesday failed to produce a deal. The issues include metrics for closing schools. “We have no choice but to cancel classes tomorrow,” Schools CEO Pedro Martinez said at a Wednesday evening news conference. Students returned to class Monday after a two-week winter break with COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations fueled by the omicron variant at record levels. School districts nationwide have grappled with the same issue , with most opting to stay open while ramping up virus testing, tweaking protocols and other adjustments in response to the shifting pandemic. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, echoing President Joe Biden a day earlier , said Wednesday that the country is better equipped now to make sure schools can safely open “including in Chicago,” while former President Donald Trump called the closures “devastating.” Chicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey said teachers don’t want to return to in-person instruction until the current surge has subsided. “We’d rather be in our classes teaching, we’d rather have the schools open. What we are saying though is that right now we’re in the middle of a major surge, it is breaking all the records and hospitals are full,” he said during a Wednesday morning news conference with other union officials, teachers and parents. The union’s action, approved by 73% of members, called for remote instruction until “cases substantially subside” or union leaders approve an agreement for safety protocols with the district. The district said early Tuesday that classes would be canceled Wednesday if the union voted not to return to in-person instruction. Devices were not distributed to students ahead of the union vote, which was announced just before 11 p.m. Tuesday. Union members who tried to log into teaching systems Wednesday said they were locked out. District officials blamed the union for the late cancellation, saying despite safety measures including a high teacher vaccination rate, “our teachers are not willing to report to work.” “We are deeply concerned about this decision but even more concerned about its impact on the health, safety, and well-being of our students and families,\" the district said in a statement. CPS leaders said a plan would come later Wednesday to “continue student learning” in the district, where students are largely low income and Black and Latino. School officials labeled the union action an “illegal work stoppage” and said those who did not report to schools Wednesday would not be compensated. Last year during a similar debate, the district punished teachers who did not come to schools . Keyonna Payton, a teacher at Park Manor Elementary School who also chairs its safety committee, said she taught remotely Monday and Tuesday because most of her students were at home under quarantine. Payton said she is vaccinated and boosted, and she has a child who attends classes in the district who is also vaccinated, but she's fearful of the variant spreading to her family, including her 91-year-old grandmother. “I’m doing my part to try to protect my children. However, I am afraid of this virus and variant because of how fast it is moving and spreading,” she said during the Wednesday news conference. Danelda Craig, a parent who also spoke at the news conference, said she was “taken aback” by a suggestion from the city’s public health commissioner that people could wear two masks to improve protection. Craig said most children struggle with one. “We want them to go to school,” she said. “What we don’t want is COVID with it.” In Illinois, masks are required in indoor settings, including schools. While some significantly smaller, neighboring school districts have returned or plan to return to class this week, others have temporarily returned to remote learning. Niles Township High School District 219 in Skokie, just north of Chicago, switched to remote learning for the first two weeks of January due to staffing shortages, while the Lincoln Way district southwest of Chicago did so for one week, also due to staffing. In Chicago, the district proposed guidelines for individual school closures, saying safety measures like required masks, availability of vaccines and improved ventilation make schools among the safest places for kids to be. Roughly 100,000 students and 91% of CPS’ more than 47,000 staff in the district are vaccinated, according to the district. But the union, with roughly 25,000 members, has proposed metrics for districtwide closure, citing risks to students and teachers. A fierce battle took place last January over similar issues. The district said it has provided 200,000 KN95 masks to teachers, would allow schools to resume daily health screening questions for students and building visitors and would spell out metrics for closing individual schools. Schools CEO Pedro Martinez said buildings would remain open for “essential services,” but not instruction. The district said food service and COVID-19 testing would be available at schools but after-school activities would be canceled. ___ Associated Press writers Sara Burnett in Chicago and Rick Callahan in Indianapolis contributed to this report. ___ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen Sophia Tareen, The Associated Press   \n",
       "1  CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago school leaders canceled classes for a second straight day after failing to reach an agreement Wednesday with the teachers union over remote learning and other COVID-19 safety protocols in the nation's third-largest school district. The Chicago Teachers Union, which voted to revert to online instruction, told teachers to stay home Wednesday during the latest COVID-19 surge while both sides negotiate, prompting district officials to cancel classes two days after students returned from winter break. Chicago Public Schools, like most other districts, has rejected retuning to remote learning, saying it worsened racial inequities and was detrimental to academic performance, mental health and attendance. District officials insist schools can safely remain open with protocols in place. Both sides negotiated behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon but failed to produce an agreement. The issues include metrics that would trigger school closures and more COVID-19 testing. For instance, school leaders support remote learning only at the classroom and school level when there are outbreaks, as has been the case this year, versus a districtwide switch to remote learning which the union has supported. “We know that our schools are safe. Yes. Do we have challenges across individual schools? Absolutely. Do we respond? Absolutely,\" Schools CEO Pedro Martinez told reporters Wednesday evening. He said the situation with the union left “no choice but to cancel” Thursday, something that will affect roughly 350,000 students. Martinez said students may be able to start returning to schools on Friday for services like tutoring or counseling depending on how many staff members show up. Buildings stayed open Wednesday for meal pickup in the largely low-income and Black and Latino school district. Union President Jesse Sharkey said teachers don’t want to return to in-person instruction until the current surge has subsided. “We’d rather be in our classes teaching, we’d rather have the schools open. What we are saying though is that right now we’re in the middle of a major surge, it is breaking all the records and hospitals are full,” he said during a Wednesday morning news conference. The union has argued that the district's safety measures fall short, including a holiday testing program, and that its COVID-19 infection data is often inaccurate. They've sought demands similar to a safety agreement put in place last year after a fierce debate. However, the district says the pandemic is different now than a year ago and requires a different response, particularly with a highly-vaccinated teacher population. City officials, who've characterized the union action as an “illegal work stoppage” and said teachers that don't show up won't be paid, were also mulling legal options to force teachers back in classrooms. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint, but didn't elaborate. School districts nationwide have grappled with the same issues , with most opting to stay open while ramping up virus testing, tweaking protocols and other adjustments in response to the shifting pandemic. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, echoing President Joe Biden a day earlier , said Wednesday that the country is better equipped now to make sure schools can safely open “including in Chicago,” while former President Donald Trump called the closures “devastating.” The cancelation meant more frustration for families strained by the pandemic who would again have to make other arrangements. The disruptions follow a teachers strike in 2019 . Parent Danelda Craig, who spoke at the union’s news conference, said she was “taken aback” by the city’s public health commissioner’s suggestion that people could wear two masks to improve protection. Craig said most children struggle with one. “We want them to go to school,” she said. “What we don’t want is COVID with it.” Still, some schools reported low attendance this week, with students either in required isolation or staying home voluntarily to avoid exposure during the omicron-fueled surge. Infections and hospitalizations are at record levels nationwide, including in Chicago which reported 4,775 average daily cases, up from under 1,000 a month ago. Phillip Cantor, a science teacher at North-Grand High School on the West Side, said his freshman and senior classes were about half empty earlier this week as his email filled with alerts about students forced to remain out due to COVID exposure. More than a dozen teachers also were out and there was one substitute available, so other teachers and staff helped monitor their classrooms, he said. Cantor said voting in favor of Wednesday’s remote action was difficult because a lack of laptops and internet access made it likely that all of his students couldn’t flip overnight. But he called school days like those following the winter break “completely untenable” and risky. “I’m not worried about my own health really, but I have students who have lost multiple family members in this pandemic,” Cantor said. “There’s been a lot of COVID-related trauma in the community and I don’t want to see more.” District officials blamed the union for the situation, saying it spent about $100 million on its school safety plan, including classroom air purifiers. Masks are required in schools and 91% of CPS’ more than 47,000 staff are vaccinated, according to the district. Some classes and schools have temporarily gone remote with outbreaks this academic year. And Chicago purchased 100,000 laptops last month in anticipation of more remote instruction, but it was unclear how many students have school-issued devices. The union and parents have complained that there aren’t enough and access has been unequal. District officials sidestepped recent questions about the school-issued devices. ——— Associated Press writers Sara Burnett and Kathleen Foody in Chicago and Rick Callahan in Indianapolis contributed to this report.   \n",

(Proverb 14:7)\\nBiblehub Commentaries – Excerpts\\n7. Avoid the society of those who cannot teach you. (JFB)\\nAvoid the company and conversation of ungodly men, when they break forth into foolish or wicked discourses, lest thou either be infected by them, or seem to approve of them. (MP)\\nWhat’s My Point?\\nTrump’s statement while impossible at this time to accommodate 330, 000 public school students, is a viable legal alternative parents should consider because in fact, most politicians and 40 percent of public-school teachers send their own children to private and religious schools now, including Mayor Lightfoot and President Obama.\\nPerhaps for the same reasons Trump stated, or because their religious values are illegal to be taught in secular religious schools.\\nIn My Opinion\\nFor some reason, in the State o Illinois, it is taboo for most politicians to support school vouchers to allow parents to choose the schools they prefer because they cannot afford to pay two tuitions, one for public schools and one for private schools, even though it is their taxes being used to fund public schools.\\nOr they are unaware that it is now possible to do in every State since the former State laws have been ruled unconstitutional.\\nAll they have to do is support legislators in the 2022 election to pass legislation in Illinois for school vouchers which already has been passed in other States.\\nSadly though, in the past fifty years in Chicago, the parochial schools have closed because of lack of funds. The result is Trump’s idea is not viable now, however, it would provide hope in the future choices for parents and communities to obtains the same level of education as the parents, same as politicians and 40 percent of public-school teachers have chosen.\\nAdd in my opinion, that if the USA government ever surveyed a comparison of how many convicted criminals in the last 50 years attended a private school vs a public secular school, the results will reveal one of the greatest reasons for crime increasing all over the USA especially in high crime urban areas.\\nIf Interested\\nRead the articles in the Source Links below\\nYou Decide\\nWise or Foolish?\\nRegards and goodwill blogging.\\nSource Links\\nChicago Tribune\\nPrevious Posts\\nSchool Vouchers\\nhttps://rudymartinka.com/category/school-vouchers/\\nChicago Violence\\nhttps://rudymartinka.com/category/chicago-violence/\\nOnly Wise or Foolish\\nBiblehub Commentaries – Excerpts\\nhttps://biblehub.com/commentaries/proverbs/14-7.htm   \n",

                            The neighbors near Mashawn Plummer’s Portage Park firehouse knew him because he often sat outside, a friendly presence at the station. He showed up early for his shifts, ready to do a job he was thrilled to have, friends and family recalled.\\nChicago Firefighter/EMT Mashawn Plummer of Engine 94. (Chicago Fire Department) Hundreds of Chicago firefighters joined family and friends on Thursday to lay Plummer to rest after he died in December battling an apartment fire on the Northwest Side. They remembered Plummer, 30, as a gentle giant who followed his dream in becoming a Chicago firefighter and EMT. He was an unapologetic mama’s boy, his family members said. He brought his best friend’s young daughters M&Ms when he visited them.\\nAdvertisement   \n",

       "1  chicago  ap    chicago school leaders canceled classes for a second straight day after failing to reach an agreement wednesday with the teachers union over remote learning and other covid    safety protocols in the nation s third largest school district  the chicago teachers union  which voted to revert to online instruction  told teachers to stay home wednesday during the latest covid    surge while both sides negotiate  prompting district officials to cancel classes two days after students returned from winter break  chicago public schools  like most other districts  has rejected retuning to remote learning  saying it worsened racial inequities and was detrimental to academic performance  mental health and attendance  district officials insist schools can safely remain open with protocols in place  both sides negotiated behind closed doors wednesday afternoon but failed to produce an agreement  the issues include metrics that would trigger school closures and more covid    testing  for instance  school leaders support remote learning only at the classroom and school level when there are outbreaks  as has been the case this year  versus a districtwide switch to remote learning which the union has supported   we know that our schools are safe  yes  do we have challenges across individual schools  absolutely  do we respond  absolutely   schools ceo pedro martinez told reporters wednesday evening  he said the situation with the union left  no choice but to cancel  thursday  something that will affect roughly         students  martinez said students may be able to start returning to schools on friday for services like tutoring or counseling depending on how many staff members show up  buildings stayed open wednesday for meal pickup in the largely low income and black and latino school district  union president jesse sharkey said teachers don t want to return to in person instruction until the current surge has subsided   we d rather be in our classes teaching  we d rather have the schools open  what we are saying though is that right now we re in the middle of a major surge  it is breaking all the records and hospitals are full   he said during a wednesday morning news conference  the union has argued that the district s safety measures fall short  including a holiday testing program  and that its covid    infection data is often inaccurate  they ve sought demands similar to a safety agreement put in place last year after a fierce debate  however  the district says the pandemic is different now than a year ago and requires a different response  particularly with a highly vaccinated teacher population  city officials  who ve characterized the union action as an  illegal work stoppage  and said teachers that don t show up won t be paid  were also mulling legal options to force teachers back in classrooms  mayor lori lightfoot said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint  but didn t elaborate  school districts nationwide have grappled with the same issues   with most opting to stay open while ramping up virus testing  tweaking protocols and other adjustments in response to the shifting pandemic  white house press secretary jen psaki  echoing president joe biden a day earlier   said wednesday that the country is better equipped now to make sure schools can safely open  including in chicago   while former president donald trump called the closures  devastating   the cancelation meant more frustration for families strained by the pandemic who would again have to make other arrangements  the disruptions

wear two masks to improve protection  craig said most children struggle with one   we want them to go to school   she said   what we don t want is covid with it   still  some schools reported low attendance this week  with students either in required isolation or staying home voluntarily to avoid exposure during the omicron fueled surge  infections and hospitalizations are at record levels nationwide  including in chicago which reported       average daily cases  up from under       a month ago  phillip cantor  a science teacher at north grand high school on the west side  said his freshman and senior classes were about half empty earlier this week as his email filled with alerts about students forced to remain out due to covid exposure  more than a dozen teachers also were out and there was one substitute available  so other teachers and staff helped monitor their classrooms  he said  cantor said voting in favor of wednesday s remote action was difficult because a lack of laptops and internet access made it likely that all of his students couldn t flip overnight  but he called school days like those following the winter break  completely untenable  and risky   i m not worried about my own health really  but i have students who have lost multiple family members in this pandemic   cantor said   there s been a lot of covid related trauma in the community and i don t want to see more   district officials blamed the union for the situation  saying it spent about      million on its school safety plan  including classroom air purifiers  masks are required in schools and     of cps  more than        staff are vaccinated  according to the district  some classes and schools have temporarily gone remote with outbreaks this academic year  and chicago purchased         laptops last month in anticipation of more remote instruction  but it was unclear how many students have school issued devices  the union and parents have complained that there aren t enough and access has been unequal  district officials sidestepped recent questions about the school issued devices      associated press writers sara burnett and kathleen foody in chicago and rick callahan in

continues  trump  biden press secretary each comment on impasse  reported trumps solution as follows  educate our children in person or give every dollar spent on education directly to the students so they can get out of these failing government schools   trump said in a statement   the purpose of this post is to relate an ancient wisdom proverb to trump s solution  king solomon go from the presence of a foolish man  when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge   proverb       biblehub commentaries   excerpts    avoid the society of those who cannot teach you   jfb  avoid the company and conversation of ungodly men  when they break forth into foolish or wicked discourses  lest thou either be infected by them  or seem to approve of them   mp  what s my point  trump s statement while impossible at this time to accommodate          public school students  is a viable legal alternative parents should consider because in fact  most politicians and    percent of public school teachers send their own children to private and religious schools now  including mayor lightfoot and president obama  perhaps for the same reasons trump stated  or because their religious values are illegal to be taught in secular religious schools  in my opinion for some reason  in the state o illinois  it is taboo for most politicians to support school vouchers to allow parents to choose the schools they prefer because they cannot afford to pay two tuitions  one for public schools and one for private schools  even though it is their taxes being used to fund public schools  or they are unaware that it is now possible to do in every state since the former state laws have been ruled unconstitutional  all they have to do is support legislators in the      election to pass legislation in illinois for school vouchers which already has been passed in other states  sadly though  in the past fifty years in chicago  the parochial schools have closed because of lack of funds
